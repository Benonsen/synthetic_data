# Synthetic data generator for genotypes and phenotypes

Software program for generating large and realistic genotype+phenotype datasets. 

Insert image giving overview of pipeline here

## Getting Started

1. Make sure that you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
2. Rest of instructions explaining how to pull the image and run the container...

### Generating synthetic datasets

1. Setup the configuration files in the `config` directory
1. Run the `synthetic_data.jl` Julia script
1. Rest of instructions for generating synthetic datasets...

### Evaluation of synthetic data quality

1. Instructions for evaluating synthetic datasets after they've been generated...

## Other pipelines

Intended for internal use

### Preprocessing

Scripts for preprocessing raw datasets, with results stored in the `data/inputs/processed` directory

### Optimisation

Likelihood-free inference procedure for selecting optimal parameter values, which are set as the defaults in the synthetic data algorithm
